Lunch Coordinator website for determining which restaurant to go to for lunch.

I used to work somewhere that had a lot of good surrounding restaurants, and 
it was sometimes time-consuming to get people to agree on where to go for
lunch.  So this website was a fair way to determine where to eat.  Each 
person would rate the restaurants in the area.  Each day, someone would go to
the website, inform the Lunch Coordinator of who was going to lunch that day.
Lunch Coordinator calculates the best place to eat based on the ratings, but
ratings are enhanced by number of selections since that restaurant was 
selected, so that higher rated restaurants came up more often but lower 
rated restaurants also would be selected eventually.
