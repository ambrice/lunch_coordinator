<h3>Welcome to the Lunch Coordinator!</h3>
<p>It requires some setup:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Create or join a Lunch Group</li>
  <li>Add the restaurants in your Lunch Group's area</li>
  <li>Have everyone in your Lunch Group rate the restaurants</li>
</ol>
<p>Each day, inform the Lunch Coordinator which members of your group are going to lunch.  
The Lunch Coordinator takes into account the members' ratings for each restaurant and also 
the number of selections since that restaurant was picked, and decides which restaurant you 
should visit for lunch.  Restaurants that are rated higher will come up more often than 
restaurants rated lower.  Easy and fair way to pick a restaurant!</p>
